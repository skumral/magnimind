# 1. Do the following to create a program that simulates how websites ensure that everyone has a unique username.
# 
# * Make a list of five or more usernames called current_users.
# * Make another list of five usernames called new_users. Make sure one or 
#   two of the new usernames are also in the current_users list.
# * Loop through the new_users list to see if each new username has already been used. 
#   If it has, print a message that the person will need to enter a new username. 
#   If a username has not been used, print a message saying that the username is available.
# * Make sure your comparison is case insensitive. If 'John' has been used, 'JOHN' should not be accepted.

# 2. Color probability
# You're playing a game with a friend involving a bag of marbles. In the bag are ten marbles:
# 1 smooth red marble
# 4 bumpy red marbles
# 2 bumpy yellow marbles
# 1 smooth yellow marble
# 1 bumpy green marble
# 1 smooth green marble
# 
# You can see that the probability of picking a smooth red marble from the bag is 1 / 10 or 0.10 
# and the probability of picking a bumpy yellow marble is 2 / 10 or 0.20.
# 
# The game works like this: your friend puts her hand in the bag, chooses a marble (without looking at it) 
# and tells you whether it's bumpy or smooth. Then you have to guess which color it is before she pulls it
# out and reveals whether you're correct or not.
# 
# You know that the information about whether the marble is bumpy or smooth changes the probability
# of what color it is, and you want some help with your guesses.
# 
# Write a function color_probability that takes two arguments: a color ('red', 'yellow', or 'green') 
# and a texture ('bumpy' or 'smooth') and returns the probability of drawing that combination 
# as a decimal fraction accurate to two places.
# 
# The probability should be a string and should discard any digits after the 100ths place. 
# For example, 2 / 3 or 0.6666666666666666 would become the string '0.66'. 
# Note this is different from rounding.
# 
# As a complete example, color_probability('red', 'bumpy') should return the string '0.57'.

# Set a value for the variable age, and then:
# * If the person is less than 2 years old, print a message that the person is a baby.
# * If the person is at least 2 years old but less than 4, print a message that the person is a toddler.
# * If the person is at least 4 years old but less than 13, print a message that the person is a kid.
# * If the person is at least 13 years old but less than 20, print a message that the person is a teenager.
# * If the person is at least 20 years old but less than 65, print a message that the person is an adult.
# * If the person is age 65 or older, print a message that the person is an elder.
